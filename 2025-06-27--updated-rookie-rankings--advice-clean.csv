1,Ashton Jeanty (LV),RB1,21,1,1,1,0,0,1,"Dynasty Outlook: I know this was the outcome that many mocked during the entire draft process, but now it is set in stone. The Raiders & Pete Carroll have their featured bellcow back. Jeanty should be the RB1 in this class for redraft and dynasty."
2,Tetairoa McMillan (CAR),WR1,22,2,7,3.9,1.4,-1,1,"Dynasty Outlook: The Carolina Panthers selected McMillan inside the top ten in the NFL Draft, giving Bryce Young a true WR1. McMillan could be a wonderful volume hog this year in what could quickly become a pass-heavy offense."
3,Omarion Hampton (LAC),RB2,22,2,4,2.3,0.6,0,1,"Dynasty Outlook: Hampton lands in Los Angeles with first-round draft capital attached to his name. While I know that Najee Harris is already on this roster, I'm not worried about Hampton's ability to take over as the lead back."
4,Travis Hunter (JAC),WR2,22,3,5,3.8,0.7,1,1,"Dynasty Outlook: The Jaguars paid a hefty price, but they got their guy in Travis Hunter. The Jags have stated that Hunter will begin his NFL career with the main focus being on the offensive side of the ball."
5,RJ Harvey (DEN),RB3,24,7,18,11.1,3.1,-5,2,"Dynasty Outlook: IT'S R.J. HARVEY'S WORLD & WE'RE ALL JUST LIVING IN IT! I couldn't be happier for Harvey and the Broncos. This is a wonderful pairing of situation and talent. Harvey will get the opportunity to prove he belongs."
6,TreVeyon Henderson (NE),RB4,22,4,11,6.7,2.4,0,2,"Dynasty Outlook: Henderson didn't get the first-round draft capital that we all hoped for, but he landed in the second round with the New England Patriots, so it's not all doom and gloom for his dynasty value."
7,Tyler Warren (IND),TE1,23,7,12,9.4,1.7,3,2,"Dynasty Outlook: Warren got the ballyhooed first-round draft capital that we all figured he would. The landing spot is rough, though. Indy has a ton of talented pass-catching options, so Warren will have to compete for targets."
8,Colston Loveland (CHI),TE2,21,5,12,7.9,2.1,10,2,"Dynasty Outlook: Loveland surprised some in the NFL Draft as the first tight end off the board. I'm not shocked by it, but I did think Warren would hear his name called first. Loveland should be a solid contributor."
9,Kaleb Johnson (PIT),RB5,21,5,12,9.4,2.1,-1,2,"Dynasty Outlook: After Johnson was maligned after the combine for his 'slow' 40-yard dash time, the fantasy community seemingly was turned off by him. I never waivered in my love for his game."
10,Tre Harris (LAC),WR3,23,11,17,14.1,1.8,0,3,"Dynasty Outlook: Harris, the soul-snatching route savant, lands with the Bolts in the second round of the NFL Draft and should quickly become Justin Herbert's trusted second option."
11,Emeka Egbuka (TB),WR4,22,4,13,8.3,2.3,2,3,"Dynasty Outlook: Egbuka is this year's Jaxon Smith-Njigba or Rome Odunze. The talented first-round selection in the NFL draft finds himself in a squeeze for target volume immediately."
12,Jayden Higgins (HOU),WR5,22,12,17,14.8,1.9,-4,3,"Dynasty Outlook: Higgins got the capital I was hoping for as the fifth wide receiver selected in the NFL Draft at the top of the second round. Higgins should immediately file in as a starter."
13,Quinshon Judkins (CLE),RB6,21,5,10,6.9,1.3,1,3,"Dynasty Outlook: Judkins got the draft capital and clear runway for volume that many had hoped for with his transition to the NFL. The Browns took him early in the second round."
14,Matthew Golden (GB),WR6,21,8,15,12.1,2.7,-3,3,"Dynasty Outlook: Well, Golden got the draft capital alley-oop as the Packers bucked their previous trend and sent the card to the podium in the first round of the NFL Draft."
15,Jaxson Dart (NYG),QB1,22,17,27,21.7,3,3,4,"Dynasty Outlook: Well, it happened. Jaxson Dart got first-round NFL draft capital. In the end, only Dart and Cam Ward walk away with first-round draft capital, and they stand alone at the top."
16,Cameron Ward (TEN),QB2,23,8,19,13.6,2.9,0,4,"Dynasty Outlook: Well, there was no surprise at the top of the draft. No, last-minute shifting of the pick or drama. Tennessee zeroed in on Cam Ward, and he's now the face of the franchise."
17,Jaylin Noel (HOU),WR7,22,15,36,22.3,5.8,1,4,"Dynasty Outlook: Noel was disrespected by the NFL as he dropped into the third round of the NFL Draft. The Houston Texans stopped his tumble and called his name."
18,Jack Bech (LV),WR8,22,17,25,20.2,2.6,2,4,"Dynasty Outlook: Bech heard his name called during the NFL Draft earlier than many expected. The Raiders selected him with the 26th pick in the second round."
19,Luther Burden III (CHI),WR9,21,7,16,12.4,2.6,3,4,"Dynasty Outlook: The manufactured touch king of Missouri heads to the Chicago Bears via the second round of the NFL Draft. The Ben Johnson faith and steam will give Burden a high floor."
20,Bhayshul Tuten (JAC),RB7,23,16,25,19.8,2.7,0,4,"Dynasty Outlook: Jacksonville added to their backfield with the selection of Tuten in the fourth round of the NFL Draft. Travis Etienne is gone after this year, and Tank Bigsby has not shown enough to keep Tuten off the field."
21,Elijah Arroyo (SEA),TE3,21,19,35,25.4,5,-1,4,"Dynasty Outlook: Arroyo is headed to Seattle after the team called his name in the second round of the NFL Draft. The former Miami Hurricane is an athletic mismatch weapon who will get a chance to shine."
22,Terrance Ferguson (LAR),TE4,22,21,43,32.5,7.6,1,4,"Dynasty Outlook: The Rams now have their heir apparent to Tyler Higbee. Higbee is a free agent after this season. I expect Ferguson to get his feet wet in his rookie season and assume the starting job next year."
23,Harold Fannin Jr. (CLE),TE5,20,28,37,33,2.5,13,4,"Dynasty Outlook: Fannin Jr. received strong draft capital for a tight end (third round) when the Browns selected him as the heir apparent to David Njoku, who will become an unrestricted free agent soon."
24,Jarquez Hunter (LAR),RB8,22,29,59,36.1,8.2,-6,4,"Dynasty Outlook: Hunter is arbitrage Bhayshul Tuten in rookie drafts. Hunter, much like Tuten, is headed to the NFL (Rams) via the fourth round of the NFL draft."
25,Cam Skattebo (NYG),RB9,23,15,23,19,2.3,-6,4,"Dynasty Outlook: The bulldozing behemoth back from Arizona State is headed to the Big Apple after the Giants picked him in round four of the NFL Draft. Skattebo will immediately compete for touches."
26,Mason Taylor (NYJ),TE6,21,19,35,25.4,5,-1,4,"Dynasty Outlook: Taylor is headed to the Jets after they selected him in the second round of the NFL Draft. Taylor could become the number two target in the passing attack quickly, especially if injuries strike."
27,Tyler Shough (NO),QB3,25,23,45,33.3,7.8,-7,4,"Dynasty Outlook: With Derek Carr retiring, the pick of Tyler Shough inside the top 50 in the NFL Draft makes more sense. He will compete in camp to be the Saints' Week 1 starter, and could win the job."
28,Jalen Royals (KC),WR10,22,23,38,29.4,5,3,4,"Dynasty Outlook: Royals' draft capital outlook was unclear entering the NFL Draft. Coming from the small school of Utah State, having injuries impact his final season and his predraft process made him a risky selection."
29,Kyle Williams (NE),WR11,22,15,28,20.6,3.9,-1,4,"Dynasty Outlook: Williams hive stand up! Williams gained a lot of traction in the fantasy community in the predraft process, with plenty of people hyping up the former Washington State Cougar."
30,Elic Ayomanor (TEN),WR12,22,23,37,28.6,4.5,10,4,"Dynasty Outlook: Ayomanor got a lot of positive buzz during the NFL Draft process, only to slip to the fourth round of the NFL Draft. The fall was possibly due to some medical concerns."
31,Jaydon Blue (DAL),RB10,21,21,32,26.8,4.2,-4,4,"Dynasty Outlook: Blue fell to the fifth round of the NFL Draft as he was swimming in a ridiculously deep running back draft class. The former Longhorn displayed some three-down big play ability in college."
32,Pat Bryant (DEN),WR13,22,27,53,36.5,7.4,-8,4,"Dynasty Outlook: The Denver Broncos surprised everyone by selecting Pat Bryant in the third round of the NFL Draft. In the post-draft presser, Sean Payton compared Bryant's game to Courtland Sutton."
33,Dylan Sampson (CLE),RB11,20,22,39,28.1,4.6,1,4,"Dynasty Outlook: Sampson joins the Cleveland Browns after being selected in the fourth round of the NFL Draft. He'll pair with Quinshon Judkins, forming the new-look duo for the Browns."
34,Tai Felton (MIN),WR15,22,38,56,45.4,6.6,8,4,"Dynasty Outlook: The Vikings called Felton's name in the third round of the NFL Draft. Once he's up to speed, he should push Jalen Nailor for the team's starting slot receiver role."
35,Isaac TeSlaa (DET),WR17,23,31,72,46.9,13.8,-8,4,"Dynasty Outlook: TeSlaa was one of the most surprising picks of the entire NFL Draft, both in relation to his draft capital (round three) and the amount Detroit gave up to trade up for him."
36,Savion Williams (GB),WR16,23,36,70,45.6,9.1,4,4,"Dynasty Outlook: The Packers added another piece to their already complicated wide receiver room with the selection of Savion Williams in the third round of the NFL Draft. Green Bay continues to build."
37,Brashard Smith (KC),RB19,22,36,51,44.2,4.5,-9,4,"Dynasty Outlook: Smith was another talented victim of this deep running back class. He dropped all the way to the seventh round of the NFL Draft, which was surprising. The Chiefs add a versatile option."
38,DJ Giddens (IND),RB13,21,28,48,37.2,5.7,-7,4,"Dynasty Outlook: My predraft man crush for Giddens was real. He was my predraft RB6, but his fall to the fifth round of the NFL Draft has cooled my hope and outlook for his NFL future."
39,Shedeur Sanders (CLE),QB5,23,25,59,41.5,9.9,-7,4,"Dynasty Outlook: I'm not going to discuss Sanders' fall in the NFL Draft, but it happened, and now the big question is, 'How do we react in Dynasty rookie drafts?' Sanders is now a Brown."
40,Jalen Milroe (SEA),QB3,22,22,42,28.8,5.7,9,4,"Dynasty Outlook: The former Crimson Tide dual-threat signal caller fell to the third round of the NFL Draft despite drawing some late first-round buzz close to the draft. The Seahawks gave him a shot."
41,Tahj Brooks (CIN),RB18,23,33,58,43.8,6.4,-4,4,"Dynasty Outlook: Brooks lands in Cincy via the sixth round of the NFL Draft. With the depth of his running back class, it isn't surprising to see him having slipped that far down the board."
42,Devin Neal (NO),RB11,21,28,44,34.4,5.2,-3,4,"Dynasty Outlook: The depth of this running back struck another of my predraft love list players as Devin Neal fell to the sixth round of the NFL Draft. The New Orleans Saints stopped his slide."
43,Trevor Etienne (CAR),RB16,20,26,52,41.2,6.9,6,4,"Dynasty Outlook: With all of the needs that the Carolina Panthers have, I didn't see them investing a fourth-round draft pick in a running back. My big takeaway from this selection, however, is intrigue."
44,Brashard Smith (KC),RB19,22,36,51,44.2,4.5,-9,4,"Dynasty Outlook: Smith was another talented victim of this deep running back class. He dropped all the way to the seventh round of the NFL Draft, which was surprising. The Chiefs add a versatile option."
45,Tai Felton (MIN),WR15,22,38,56,45.4,6.6,8,4,"Dynasty Outlook: The Vikings called Felton's name in the third round of the NFL Draft. Once he's up to speed, he should push Jalen Nailor for the team's starting slot receiver role."
