Round 1,,,,,,,
Pick,Rnd. Pick,Team,Player,Pos.,College,Actual,Notes
1,1,Tennessee,Cam Ward,Q,Miami (Fla.),,They locked into him early in the process as the guy who can turn their franchise around. The question is whether he's an elite player or a quarterback being forced up the board because of need.
2,2,Cleveland,Travis Hunter,ATH,Colorado,,"He is the best player in the draft, so just take him. The Browns will play him at receiver and spot him in at corner. They can get a quarterback at the top of Round 2."
3,3,N.Y. Giants,Abdul Carter,EDGE,Penn State,,"Take the best edge player and add him to your deep, talented front. It just makes sense. Either take a quarterback later in the draft or get one next year."
4,4,New England,Will Campbell,OT,LSU,,"The Patriots need a left tackle, which is why Campbell should be the pick. I think he's more guard than tackle, but they can play him at left tackle to protect Drake Maye's blindside."
5,5,Jacksonville,Ashton Jeanty,RB,Boise State,,They take a back in this spot after failing to trade down. They pass on Mason Graham to take the third-best player in this draft. He helps the passing game by juicing up the run game.
6,6,Las Vegas,Kelvin Banks Jr.,OT,Texas,,"With Jeanty off the board, they go big and take a right tackle who can start right away. Banks could also play guard if need be. They could also consider Mason Graham here, but I think they go big on offense."
7,7,N.Y. Jets,Armand Membou,OT,Missouri,,"They decide to take a player who can give them bookend tackle for years to come. They could also consider Penn State tight end Tyler Warren here, but I think offensive line will win out."
8,8,Carolina,Jalon Walker,LB,Georgia,,"The Panthers could look at Mason Graham here, but they need more help on the edge after adding two defensive tackles in free agency. Walker can play off the ball as well."
9,9,New Orleans,Mykel Williams,EDGE,Georgia,,"The Saints need offensive line help, but the way the board plays out the top tackles are gone. So they take a power edge player for a team that needs help rushing the passer."
10,10,Chicago,Colston Loveland,TE,Michigan,,The Bears haven't had a great pass-catching tight end for a bit. Loveland is the better of the top two tight ends in terms of pass-catching ability. Ben Johnson will love having him to team up with Cole Kmet.
11,11,San Francisco,Walter Nolen,DL,Ole Miss,,"Their defensive tackle spot is a mess. They pass on taking Mason Graham here to take Nolen, who some scouts think will be better. Nolen has the tools to be a dominant player if focused."
12,12,Dallas,Tetairoa McMillan,WR,Arizona,,"The Cowboys need to balance their passing game to go with CeeDee Lamb. McMillan has been compared to Mike Evans, but I think he's more like Drake London. That will still help Dak Prescott."
13,13,Miami,Mason Graham,DL,Michigan,,"This is a big fall for Graham, who some saw as a potential top-5 pick. He isn't a big player for the position, but he is technically sound. The Dolphins have a major need."
14,14,Indianapolis,Tyler Warren,TE,Penn State,,"He is the best all-round tight end in the class. The Colts lack a dominant tight end and Warren will give them that. He's also a good blocker, which matters with Jonathan Taylor as the focal point of the offense."
15,15,Atlanta,James Pearce Jr.,EDGE,Tennessee,,"He is a top-10 player, but has some character concerns. Even so, the Falcons need edge help. He is worth taking a chance on in this spot."
16,16,Arizona,Jihaad Campbell,LB,Alabama,,They take a playmaker for their defense who can do for them what Zack Baun did for the Eagles. Jonathan Gannon knows defense and knows he can use help at linebacker.
17,17,Cincinnati,Derrick Harmon,DL,Oregon,,The interior of their defense remains a question mark. When was the last time they had a push-the-pocket inside player? Was it Geno Atkins? Harmon can do that.
18,18,Seattle,Nick Emmanwori,S,South Carolina,,The word around the league is that they see this kid as their Kyle Hamilton. Mike Macdonald came from the Ravens and was there when Hamilton was picked. They could also consider offensive line here.
19,19,Tampa Bay,Maxwell Hairston,CB,Kentucky,,"Their corner situation needs help and they are talking about moving Tykee Smith to safety from nickel. That means they need help. In their scheme, Hairston's speed will be a big plus."
20,20,Denver,Emeka Egbuka,WR,Ohio State,,"They can get their back later, so taking a receiver to help the passing game makes sense. Teams love Egbuka in terms of his pro-ready demeanor."
21,21,Pittsburgh,Kenneth Grant,DL,Michigan,,"They pass on the quarterback to take an interior player, which they like to do. Grant is a power player who can help offset the loss of Cam Heyward when he retires."
22,22,L.A. Chargers,Mike Green,EDGE,Marshall,,"The Chargers have vet Khalil Mack on a one-year deal, so they need to get a younger edge player. They could consider receiver here, but I think they pass to take Green."
23,23,Green Bay,Matthew Golden,WR,Texas,,"He has the speed teams covet, which the Packers badly need with Christian Watson coming off injury. Golden would be my top-ranked receiver, but I think he lasts until this spot."
24,24,Minnesota,Malaki Starks,S,Georgia,,They let Cam Bynum go to the Colts and Harrison Smith is coming to the end. They need a rangy player on the back end and Starks is that guy.
25,25,Houston,Donovan Jackson,IOL,Ohio State,,"The Texans have revamped their offensive line, but it isn't much better. Jackson can play either guard spot or tackle and there is value in that. Teams love him as a person."
26,26,L.A. Rams,Mason Taylor,TE,LSU,,"They need a tight end who can get down the field and Taylor is that type of player. I think he's one of the most-underrated players in this draft, a productive college player who will produce on the next level."
27,27,Baltimore,Shemar Stewart,EDGE,Texas A&M,,They have three edge players with expiring contracts after the season. They have to get a young speedy rusher. Stewart has a ton of tools and could wait a year to be an every-down player as he improves his techniques.
28,28,Detroit,Grey Zabel,IOL,North Dakota State,,They can get a player to push for time at right guard next year and ultimately become their center of the future when Frank Ragnow retires. Zabel's versatility would be a nice addition to a good offensive line.
29,29,Washington,Jahdae Barron,CB,Texas,,"The Commanders would like to add another corner or safety and Barron can do both, according to some scouts. He has a Brian Branch feel to his game."
30,30,Buffalo,Will Johnson,CB,Michigan,,"A long zone corner with great instincts is exactly what the Bills need. They don't play a ton of man, which is why Johnson works in their defense. His 40-yard dash time is worrisome, but he plays fast enough."
31,31,Kansas City,Josh Simmons,OT,Ohio State,,"They signed Jaylon Moore to be their left tackle, but he's on a two-year deal and he's not a slam dunk. Simmons is the best left tackle in this class, but he is coming off a torn patellar tendon. They can be patient."
32,32,Philadelphia,Josh Conerly Jr.,OT,Oregon,,"With some of the edge players off the board, they can settle in and take a tackle who can take over when Lane Johnson retires. Conerly is an athletic player with a lot of upside."
