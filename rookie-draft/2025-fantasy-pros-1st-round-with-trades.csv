Round 1,,,,,,,
Pick,Rnd. Pick,Team,Player,Position,School,Actual,Description
1,1,Tennessee Titans,Cam Ward,QB,Miami,,Lock it in. The Titans get their (hopeful) quarterback of the future.
2,2,Cleveland Browns,Travis Hunter,WR/CB,Colorado,,"Despite getting calls to trade out of this pick, the Browns stand pat and take arguably the best player in the draft."
3,3,New York Giants,Abdul Carter,EDGE,Penn State,,"While Abdul Carter isn’t necessarily a “need,” he’s too good to pass on. Kayvon Thibodeaux could be upset about this, but that’s something worth dealing with. This would give the Giants a ferocious pass rush."
4,4,New England Patriots,Will Campbell,OT,LSU,,"I’m still not 100% sold that Will Campbell plays tackle long-term at the next level, but in the worst-case scenario, he’s a fantastic guard for a decade-plus. Either way, the Patriots are backed into a corner here. This is a massive need, and Campbell will be a consistent producer throughout his career."
5,5,Jacksonville Jaguars,Tetairoa McMillan,WR,Arizona,,"The Jaguars could trade down here to accumulate more assets, but I’ll stand pat and take the Arizona receiver. New head coach Liam Coen gets his Mike Evans-like pass-catcher."
6,6,Las Vegas Raiders,Kelvin Banks Jr.,OT,Texas,,"For a while, I think the draft community was somewhat overthinking Kelvin Banks Jr. Now, the Raiders get their left tackle of the future with Kolton Miller seeking a new contract."
7,7,New York Jets,Armand Membou,OT,Missouri,,"I think this pick is either Armand Membou or Penn State tight end Tyler Warren. Ultimately, I think they’ll side with Membou to help protect Breece Hall and Justin Fields to give them a chance to compete. This one makes far too much sense."
8,8,Chicago Bears,Ashton Jeanty,RB,Boise State,,Bears general manager Ryan Poles said he expects “a lot more” trades this year than in the past. The Bears move up a couple of spots to ensure they get their guy to complete this Ben Johnson offense.
9,9,New Orleans Saints,Mykel Williams,EDGE,Georgia,,"With the temptation of Tetairoa McMillan and Ashton Jeanty gone, all signs are pointing to the Saints to get an heir apparent to Cameron Jordan. Mykel Williams is similar to Jordan with his extremely long arms and fantastic athleticism."
10,10,Indianapolis Colts,Tyler Warren,TE,Penn State,,The Colts haven’t had a tight end go for 800 yards in a season since Dallas Clark during the Obama administration. It’s time. Let’s get this figured out.
11,11,San Francisco 49ers,Walter Nolen,DT,Ole Miss,,"I believe the 49ers think they can help mold Day 2 offensive linemen, as seen with Dominick Puni from last year. Thus, they take an absolute freak of nature (in the best way) in Walter Nolen."
12,12,Dallas Cowboys,Tyler Booker,OG,Alabama,,"With Zack Martin retiring, the Cowboys get an instant replacement. If Tetairoa McMillan were available, I don’t see how they pass on him, but he isn’t available in this situation."
13,13,Denver Broncos,Colston Loveland,TE,Michigan,,"The Broncos signed Evan Engram, but that won’t stop them from adding a playmaker like Colston Loveland, who has perhaps the best hands of any receiving option in the draft."
14,14,Carolina Panthers,Jalon Walker,EDGE,Georgia,,The Panthers desperately need EDGE help. I might regret passing on Mason Graham here later. We’ll see.
15,15,Atlanta Falcons,Shemar Stewart,EDGE,Texas A&M,,The Falcons are another team that desperately needs EDGE rush help. Defensive-minded head coach Raheem Morris gets an athletic specimen in Shemar Stewart.
16,16,Arizona Cardinals,Mason Graham,DT,Michigan,,"Mason Graham is probably a top-five player, but playing out these scenarios, this is where he lands. The Cardinals benefit from his slide."
17,17,Cincinnati Bengals,Mike Green,EDGE,Marshall,,"The Bengals are having issues retaining Trey Hendrickson, and Mike Green fills an instant need. There are some intriguing offensive line options available, but I think they’ll stick with EDGE rusher here."
18,18,Seattle Seahawks,Grey Zabel,OL,North Dakota State,,This makes far too much sense. The Seahawks cannot allow their offensive line to be in the shape it’s in going into their first year with Sam Darnold as their quarterback.
19,19,Tampa Bay Buccaneers,Jihaad Campbell,LB,Alabama,,"Given Chris Godwin‘s health and Mike Evans’ aging, I could see them going for a receiver here, but Jihaad Campbell is the best player at his position in the draft."
20,20,Miami Dolphins,Malaki Starks,S,Georgia,,"The Dolphins desperately need safety help. He may not be the athlete Nick Emmanwori is, but Malaki Starks will be steady for years to come."
21,21,Los Angeles Rams,Omarion Hampton,RB,North Carolina,,"The Rams acquire a dynamic running back. Kyren Williams‘ contract expires soon, and Hampton fills a major need."
22,22,Los Angeles Chargers,TreVeyon Henderson,RB,Ohio State,,"NFL Network’s Daniel Jeremiah mocked TreVeyon Henderson to the Chargers, and if there’s anyone I trust when it comes to Chargers coverage, it’s Jeremiah."
23,23,Green Bay Packers,Maxwell Hairston,CB,Kentucky,,"The Packers might soon be saying farewell to Jaire Alexander. Maxwell Hairston is an athletic, speedy corner from the SEC. He seems right up the Packers’ alley."
24,24,New York Giants,Jaxson Dart,QB,Ole Miss,,"All signs point to the Giants liking Jaxson Dart over Shedeur Sanders. Dart needs a year to sit and develop, making this a perfect situation."
25,25,Houston Texans,Josh Simmons,OL,Ohio State,,"The slide for Josh Simmons ends here. If his torn patellar checks out, he’s an easy selection as their left tackle of the future."
26,26,Pittsburgh Steelers,Emeka Egbuka,WR,Ohio State,,"With recent developments surrounding George Pickens, including him unfollowing the team on social media, I think he’s a trade candidate. Emeka Egbuka feels like a Pittsburgh Steeler."
27,27,Baltimore Ravens,Kenneth Grant,DT,Michigan,,"Kenneth Grant fills in nicely on the defensive interior, with Michael Pierce calling it a career. His run-game presence has the makings of an AFC North player."
28,28,Detroit Lions,JT Tuimoloau,EDGE,Ohio State,,JT Tuimoloau feels like a guy the Lions would covet. He had a fantastic College Football Playoff and would line up opposite Aidan Hutchinson.
29,29,Washington Commanders,Will Johnson,CB,Michigan,,The value is too good to pass up. Will Johnson reunites with Mike Sainristil.
30,30,Buffalo Bills,Jahdae Barron,DB,Texas,,"Jahdae Barron is a Brian Branch-like player, and the Bills desperately need help in the secondary. His versatility seems like something the Bills would covet."
31,31,Kansas City Chiefs,Josh Conerly Jr.,OT,Oregon,,"The Chiefs desperately need offensive line help, and Josh Conerly Jr. is the best guy on the board."
32,32,Philadelphia Eagles,Matthew Golden,WR,Texas,,Matthew Golden gives the Eagles a truly daunting trio of receivers with A.J. Green and DeVonta Smith. His value is too good to pass up.
