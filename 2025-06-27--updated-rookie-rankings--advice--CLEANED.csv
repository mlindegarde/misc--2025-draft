1,Ashton Jeanty,RB1,21,1,1,1,0,0,Tier 1,"I know this was the outcome that many mocked during the entire draft process, but now it is set in stone. The Raiders & Pete Carroll have their featured bellcow back. With Chip Kelly at the offensive controls, I expect Las Vegas to rank inside the top ten in rushing attempts. During Kelly's tenure in the NFL, his offenses have never ranked lower than 11th in rushing attempts. Jeanty should also see plenty of passing game involvement, with only Jakobi Meyers and Brock Bowers ahead of him in the target pecking order. During Kelly's four years as an NFL offensive coordinator, in three of those seasons, his backfields had a 16.6-17.7% target share, but he also flooded his Philly backfield with targets in 2015 (28.7%). Jeanty remains the clear 1.01 in every dynasty format."
2,Tetairoa McMillan,WR1,22,2,7,3.9,1.4,-1,Tier 1,"The Carolina Panthers selected McMillan inside the top ten in the NFL Draft, giving Bryce Young a true WR1. McMillan could be a wonderful volume hog this year in what looks to be an ascending passing offense. Last year, in Weeks 12-18, when Young was hitting his stride, the Panthers ranked 13th in neutral passing rate. We could see that number increase this year with a true number one option leading the way. Last year, during that same stretch, Young ranked eighth in CPOE, fifth in deep throw rate, 12th in highly accurate throw rate, and second in hero throw rate (per Fantasy Points Data). McMillian is in play as high as the 1.02 in dynasty rookie drafts (regardless of format)."
3,Omarion Hampton,RB2,22,2,4,2.3,0.6,0,Tier 1,"Hampton lands in Los Angeles with first-round draft capital attached to his name. While I know that Najee Harris is already on this roster, I'm not worried about Hampton establishing himself as the team's workhorse in short order. Harris was signed to a cheap one-year deal this offseason to give the Bolts a trusted running back to carry the load in case they missed out on a running back early in the draft. Well, Hampton dropped into the Chargers' lap, and they were unable to pass on him. In Greg Roman's 11 years of coordinating NFL offenses, he's never finished lower than 11th in rushing attempts (last year). Hampton is in the conversation as soon as the 1.02 in dynasty rookie drafts, regardless of format."
4,Travis Hunter,WR2,22,3,5,3.8,0.7,1,Tier 1,"The Jaguars paid a hefty price, but they got their guy in Travis Hunter. The Jags have stated that Hunter will begin his NFL career with the main focus being on the offensive side of the ball, which makes sense. It's not impossible but improbable that a team would make an aggressive move of this magnitude for a full-time cornerback. Hunter looks to be a full-time wide receiver with TBD status next to his corner usage. Evaluating Hunter as a wide receiver only makes him a top-five pick in every dynasty rookie draft, regardless of format. Hunter still has some substantial growth to make as a wide receiver, but he's in good hands with Liam Coen and company. I'm curious how much slot usage Hunter will get in year 1, but I'm guessing it could be at least 40-50% of his snaps. This will be immensely helpful for a player that last year (among all FBS wide receivers with at least eight slot targets) ranked fourth in slot yards per route run (per PFF)."
5,RJ Harvey,RB3,24,7,18,11.1,3.1,-5,Tier 2,"IT'S R.J. HARVEY'S WORLD & WE'RE ALL JUST LIVING IN IT! I couldn't be happier for Harvey and the Broncos. This is a wonderful pairing of situation and talent. Harvey and his second-round NFL draft capital land in a backfield where his only direct competition is Audrice Estime and Jaleel McLaughlin. Before the NFL Draft, Harvey was my RB5 of this class, but now, after the conclusion of the draft, he has risen to my RB3. I'm sky-high about his prospects and will be heavily overweight in the rookie draft season. It's hard not to love a player that ranked inside the top 20 among FBS running backs in each of the last two seasons in breakaway percentage and elusive rating (per PFF). Add in Sean Payton's running back usage, and Harvey looks primed to smash. Over the last two years, Payton has ranked fifth and first in running back target share. Harvey is in play as high as the 1.05 in every dynasty format. He's currently my 1.07 in super flex rookie rankings."
6,TreVeyon Henderson,RB4,22,4,11,6.7,2.4,0,Tier 2,"Henderson didn't get the first-round draft capital that we all hoped for, but he landed in the second round with the New England Patriots, so it's not all doom and gloom. Henderson will compete with Rhamondre Stevenson immediately for touches. The big question that remains unanswered for Henderson is what his weekly volume will look like in the NFL. Will he be a three-down workhorse? Is he destined to be a passing down back that works in on early downs amounting to 9-12 touches weekly? That's an unknown, but what we do know is that Henderson has the juice to make the most of whatever work comes his way, and his running mate (Stevenson) is an inefficient runner inherited from the previous regime. Last year, Henderson ranked seventh in yards after contact per attempt, tenth in breakaway percentage, and 22nd in receiving grade (per PFF)."
7,Tyler Warren,TE1,23,7,12,9.4,1.7,3,Tier 2,"Warren got the ballyhooed first-round draft capital that we all figured he would. The landing spot is rough, though. Indy has a ton of talented pass-catching options that will push Warren weekly for target volume. Michael Pittman and Josh Downs presumably will be above him in the target pecking order. I still love Warren as a player, but I'm worried that after year one, he won't just become the sexy buy-low for 2026. The passing volume, quarterback play, and receiving depth chart are all big-time concerns for his 2025 outlook. Last year, Indy had the third-lowest passing rate inside the red zone and in neutral game environments. I'm not fading Warren in dynasty rookie drafts, but I'm just saying temper your expectations for his rookie season. Warren is a top-ten selection in dynasty rookie drafts. Bet on talent, as situations can change quickly."
8,Colston Loveland,TE2,21,5,12,7.9,2.1,10,Tier 2,"Loveland surprised some in the NFL Draft as the first tight end off the board. I'm not shocked by it, but I did think Warren would hear his name called first. Loveland's top ten first-round capital is notable. Ben Johnson seemingly got his Sam LaPorta. I don't think Loveland is on the same talent plane as LaPorta, and I don't mean that as shade, but their skill sets are different. Loveland has stellar per-route efficiency and the route running chops to match, but he isn't the same mauler after the catch, with only eight missed tackles forced in his collegiate career (per PFF). I worry a tiny bit about Loveland's weekly route share with Cole Kmet, who is still on this roster. Loveland should be the Week 1 starter, but don't be shocked if Kmet can be enough of a thorn in his side (ala Dawson Knox) to hurt his ceiling and floor in 2025. I also haven't even mentioned a crowded target hierarchy for this season with D.J. Moore, Rome Odunze, D'Andre Swift, and Luther Burden on the roster and Caleb Williams' worrisome 2024 play. In dynasty, we're still betting on Loveland's talent, a solid landing spot, and draft capital winning out. Loveland is a top-ten selection in dynasty rookie drafts, regardless of format."
9,Kaleb Johnson,RB5,21,5,12,9.4,2.1,-1,Tier 2,"After Johnson was maligned after the combine for his ""slow"" 40-yard dash time, the fantasy community seemingly was turned off by him. I never waivered in my love for Johnson, and now we'll see some capitulation from those who were fading him after the Steelers selected him in the third round of the NFL Draft. Johnson is a perfect fit for the Steelers' run scheme, and he should be considered the early favorite to gobble up volume on the ground. Jaylen Warren remains on the roster and will prominently factor in, but Johnson has the raw talent to seize more of the work in this backfield, unlike Najee Harris could ever do. I know that's saying a lot for Johnson after Harris handled 299 touches last year, but the upside is there. Johnson has an explosive play element to his game that Harris never has after ranking fifth in breakaway percentage last year (per PFF). Johnson is a late first-round pick in dynasty rookie drafts."
10,Tre Harris,WR3,23,11,17,14.1,1.8,0,Tier 3,"Harris, the soul-snatching route savant, lands with the Bolts in the second round of the NFL Draft and should quickly become Justin Herbert's trusted second option in the passing game opposite Ladd McConkey. Yes, Harris will have to hop either Mike Williams or Quentin Johnston to crack the starting lineup, but I'm not worried about his ability to do so. We're discussing a player who has ranked first and ninth in yards per route run over the last two years, stacked up against arguably a former first-round bust and a veteran who looked like he was running on empty last year (per PFF). The Chargers are looked at as a run-heavy team, but that isn't necessarily true and might not be in 2025. Last year, after Week 7, the Bolts ranked 11th in neutral passing rate and seventh in pass rate over expectation (per Fantasy Points Data). Harris sits atop my Tier 3 of rookies and should be considered a borderline first-round rookie draft selection. Yes, I know I'm aggressively above consensus depending on which ADP of other ranking set you're looking at, but I want to be with a player who was my WR2 predraft and is my WR3 post-draft with the new addition of Travis Hunter in my wide receiver rankings. Harris is set to smash in his rookie season."
11,Emeka Egbuka,WR4,22,4,13,8.3,2.3,2,Tier 3,"Egbuka is this year's Jaxon Smith-Njigba or Rome Odunze. The talented first-round selection in the NFL draft finds himself in a squeeze for target volume immediately with Mike Evans and Chris Godwin. Yes, Godwin is coming off another major injury that could help boost Egbuka's prospects, but Evans didn't show any fall-off last year. I also haven't mentioned Jalen McMillan, who broke out down the stretch last season. Last year, among 112 qualifying wideouts, Evans ranked second in separation score and route win rate (per Fantasy Points Data). Egbuka's skillset also has some considerable overlap with Chris Godwin. All of these factors muddy the picture for Egbuka in 2025. Evans is an unrestricted free agent in 2026, and while many think he'll be out the door after 2025, I don't necessarily believe that will be true. The career Buc still looks to be at the height of his powers despite his advancing age, and if he has another similarly productive season and wants to keep playing, you better believe that Tampa Bay will retain his services so he will retire a Buccaneer. This could remain a crowded wide receiver room in 2026 and maybe even 2027. While I'm worried about Egbuka, he remains a talented wide receiver with significant first-round NFL draft capital and a strong analytical profile. He's a borderline first-round rookie draft selection that will fluctuate in ADP from league to league."
12,Jayden Higgins,WR5,22,12,17,14.8,1.9,-4,Tier 3,"Higgins got the capital I was hoping for as the fifth wide receiver selected in the NFL Draft at the top of the second round. Higgins should immediately file in as the starting outside receiver opposite Nico Collins. Higgins was an underrated player during the entire draft process after ranking 27th and 16th in yards per route run and first and 18th in receiving grade during his final two collegiate seasons (per PFF). The addition of Higgins and fellow former Iowa State wide receiver Jaylin Noel should push Christian Kirk while also hopefully fueling a big bounce-back season for C.J. Stroud. With Tank Dell likely out for the entire 2025 season, Higgins has a clear path to playing time and should be selected no later than the mid-second round of dynasty rookie drafts."
13,Quinshon Judkins,RB6,21,5,10,6.9,1.3,1,Tier 3,"Judkins got the draft capital and clear runway for volume that many had hoped for with his transition to the NFL. The Browns took him early in the second round of the NFL Draft. Judkins should be considered the easy favorite to lead the backfield in touches in 2025. I wasn't the biggest Judkins fan during this draft process, but one skill that I can't dispute is his ability to handle volume as a back that an offense can lean on. He averaged 246 carries across his three years in college. During Kevin Stefanski's five-year tenure in Cleveland, his offense finished outside of the top nine teams in rushing attempts only once (2024). I think Stefanski rectifies that abrupt change and gets back to running the rock in 2025 with Judkins spearheading the ground game. The conversation for drafting Judkins begins in the late first round of rookie drafts."
14,Matthew Golden,WR6,21,8,15,12.1,2.7,-3,Tier 3,"Well, Golden got the draft capital alley-oop as the Packers bucked their previous trend and sent the card to the podium in the first round of the NFL Draft. I'll lead this off by saying I'm lower than consensus regarding Golden. With the selection of Golden and then the team following that up by selecting Savion Williams (round 3) later in the NFL Draft, I don't think Golden will be the team's ""true WR1."" Those correlated moves speak more to Green Bay continuing their wide receiver-by-committee approach. Even if they don't and the team seeks to run more of the offense through Golden, I don't know if he has the high-end target-drawing ability to reward their faith. Golden finished his collegiate career with an 18.7% target per route run rate and 1.85 yards per route run (per PFF). Neither of those metrics screams ""future alpha WR1"" in the NFL. Despite my pessimism, Golden's draft capital alone necessitates that he be selected in the early to mid-second round of dynasty rookie drafts."
15,Jaxson Dart,QB1,22,17,27,21.7,3,3,Tier 4,"Well, it happened. Jaxson Dart got first-round NFL draft capital. In the end, only Dart and Cam Ward walk away with first-round draft capital, and they stand alone in their own tier in this rookie draft class. I know Ward was selected as the first overall pick, and Dart didn't arrive in New York until the 25th selection, but Dart is now my QB1 for this class. I have had him above Ward during the entire NFL draft cycle. I love his combination of arm talent and rushing upside. He's currently the 1.07 in our Superflex rookie ECR. Dart should be a locked-in first-round rookie draft pick. The conversation for me with Dart begins at the 1.05. In 1QB, the Dart conversation begins in the early second round of rookie drafts. I expect to see him start games sometime during the 2025 season. Russell Wilson's play and Dart's progression in training camp and the preseason will determine how early that is."
16,Cameron Ward,QB2,23,8,19,13.6,2.9,0,Tier 4,"Well, there was no surprise at the top of the draft. No, last-minute shifting of the pick or drama. Tennessee zeroed in on Cam Ward, and he's now the face of the franchise moving forward. Ward walks the highwire from down to down. There are plenty of high-end moments and special plays, but Ward also has plenty of misfires and can run through cold stretches in games. If he hits his ceiling, he could be a franchise-changing player who becomes a yearly QB1. This cements him as a top-six pick in Superflex dynasty rookie drafts and as a mid-second-round pick in 1QB formats at the latest. The big worries for Ward entering year one are the lack of proven or high-end receiving talent outside of Calvin Ridley and this new-look offensive line. Without rushing upside to pad his fantasy stats weekly, can Ward produce enough with his arm, with Ridley leading the way to be a steady fantasy quarterback in his rookie season? We'll see, but I'm skeptical. Selecting Ward in rookie drafts comes with immediate production from Week 1 and a floor of QB2 production. He's an upside swing that might not consistently flash that upside until 2026."
17,Jaylin Noel,WR7,22,15,36,22.3,5.8,1,Tier 4,"Noel was disrespected by the NFL as he dropped into the third round of the NFL Draft. The Houston Texans stopped his tumble and called his name with the 15th pick in the third round. I expect Noel to use this as fuel for the fire and walk into the building with a chip on his shoulder. Noel has the play strength, route prowess, and speed to play in the slot or on the outside. He could struggle to find playing time in his rookie season with Nico Collins, Christian Kirk, and his former collegiate teammate Jayden Higgins all sitting above him on the depth chart. Collins and Kirk have had their injury issues over the last few years, so it's easily possible that Noel will be starting by midseason. While Noel's short-term playing time is up in the air, he has the talent to exceed expectations. If there was ever a time to bet on talent over situation and landing spot, IT'S NOW with Noel. He has the goods. Last year, Noel ranked in the top 30 in receiving grade and yards per route run while sitting second in deep receiving yards among FBS wide receivers (per PFF). Noel has been consistently falling to the tail end of the second-round or the top of the third-round in rookie dynasty drafts. He's my 17th overall player in 1QB and Superflex rankings. While you might not have to draft him that high, that's the time when you should start surveying the draft board and plan out when or how you'll get into position to draft Noel."
18,Jack Bech,WR8,22,17,25,20.2,2.6,2,Tier 4,"Bech heard his name called during the NFL Draft earlier than many expected. The Raiders selected him with the 26th pick in the second round. Bech enters the building with the ability to push Jakobi Meyers for the WR2 role on the team behind Brock Bowers. He should be a starter immediately, with only those two players to compete with for a hefty target share. Geno Smith will love the route running, tenacity, and sure hands (fourth in contested catch rate, minimum 20 contested targets) that Bech brings to the table. In his final season in college, Bech ranked 17th in receiving grade and 22nd in missed tackles forced (per PFF). The former tight-end plays with a physicality and passion that is infectious. Bech is a mid-second-round pick in dynasty rookie drafts."
19,Luther Burden III,WR9,21,7,16,12.4,2.6,3,Tier 4,"The manufactured touch king of Missouri heads to the Chicago Bears via the second round of the NFL Draft. The Ben Johnson faith and steam will give Burden a high floor in dynasty rookie drafts despite the muddly path to significant targets in his rookie season. Chicago did this last year with Rome Odunze as they tossed him into a crowded target tree, and it didn't work out. Burden faces a similar hurdle with Odunze, D.J. Moore, and possibly Colston Loveland ahead of him in the hierarchy. I also didn't even mention Cole Kmet or D'Andre Swift. Burden enjoyed a ton of schemed and easy looks in college as he wasn't asked to just line up every down and route guys up. It's tough to see Burden finding his way to high-end fantasy relevance in 2025 if everyone stays healthy. He's more of a long-term play in dynasty as you invest in what we hope to be a much-improved version of the Bears offense and Caleb Williams moving forward. Burden is a mid-second-round pick in dynasty rookie drafts."
20,Bhayshul Tuten,RB7,23,16,25,19.8,2.7,0,Tier 4,"Jacksonville added to their backfield with the selection of Tuten in the fourth round of the NFL Draft. Travis Etienne is gone after this year, and Tank Bigsby has only two years left on his rookie deal. Tuten could easily be the future of the Jags' rushing attack. The combine superhero posted strong tackling breaking numbers over the last two years, ranking top-ten in elusive rating in each season (per PFF). He was also tenth in yards after contact per attempt and breakaway percentage last season. It doesn't take much effort to see that Tuten could be this year's Bucky Irving, but it also wouldn't surprise me if Etienne and Bigsby do just enough to hold him off this season, and the true breakout isn't until 2026. Tuten is a late second-round home run swing in dynasty rookie drafts."
21,Elijah Arroyo,TE3,22,24,34,28.7,3.4,6,Tier 4,"Arroyo is headed to Seattle after the team called his name in the second round of the NFL Draft. The former Miami Hurricane is an athletic mismatch weapon who will push Noah Fant for snaps from the jump if his blocking is up to snuff. Fant is an unrestricted free agent after this season, so while the outlook for 2025 has its worries, it should be wheels up for Arroyo in 2026. If Copper Kupp also proves in 2025 that he doesn't have much left in the tank, Kupp could be gone, which would leave Arroyo as the second target in the passing attack behind only Jaxon Smith-Njigba. In his final season in college, Arroyo ranked 23rd in yards per route run and second in yards after the catch per reception among tight ends (minimum 20 targets, per PFF). Arroyo is a late second-round selection in dynasty rookie drafts that will occasionally fall into the third round."
22,Terrance Ferguson,TE4,22,21,43,32.5,7.6,1,Tier 4,"The Rams now have their heir apparent to Tyler Higbee. Higbee is a free agent after this season. I expect Ferguson to get his feet wet in his rookie season and assume the starting role in 2026. At tight end, high-end athleticism is so highly correlated to high-end production. Ferguson checks that box emphatically with a 9.32 RAS score, a 4.63 40-yard dash, and 91st percentile or higher marks in the vertical and broad jumps. Last year, Ferguson also crushed it in nearly every efficiency metric I can find, ranking 14th in yards per route run and receiving grade, third in yards after the catch per reception, and 22nd in missed tackles forced (per PFF)."
23,Harold Fannin Jr.,TE5,20,28,37,33,2.5,13,Tier 4,"Fannin Jr. received strong draft capital for a tight end (third round) when the Browns selected him as the heir apparent to David Njouku, who will become an unrestricted free agent after this season. Fannin Jr.'s raw athleticism might keep him from ever becoming a truly elite option in fantasy, but he now has a path, the athletic juice, and receiving chops to become Zach Ertz 2.0. Fannin Jr. ranked first and third in yards per route run and first and fifth in missed tackles forced over the last two collegiate seasons (per PFF). Fannin Jr. is a late second-round rookie draft pick who will fall into the third round in some leagues. He's an auto pick in that range and could likely go higher in tight-end premium leagues."
24,Jarquez Hunter,RB8,22,29,59,36.1,8.2,-6,Tier 4,"Hunter is arbitrage Bhayshul Tuten in rookie drafts. Hunter, much like Tuten, is headed to the NFL (Rams) via the fourth round of the NFL draft. Also, like Tuten, Hunter finds himself possibly buried for 2025 behind two veterans, but he also possesses the talent and pathway to surpass one or maybe both of them in the running back pecking order. Kyren Williams is a free agent after this season. The Rams thought so much of Blake Corum's rookie season that they addressed running back again this year. Hunter isn't the same caliber of athlete as Tuten (7.1 RAS), but he did run a 4.44 40-yard dash and finished his collegiate career with an impressive tackle-breaking resume. Hunter has ranked inside the top 24 in yards after contact per attempt in each of the last three seasons while also sitting in the top 22 in breakaway percentage in two of three years (per PFF). Hunter offers the Rams an explosive element that neither Williams nor Corum has. Last year, among 46 qualifying backs, Williams ranked 44th in explosive run rate, 37th in missed tackles forced per attempt, and 40th in yards after contact per attempt (per FantasyPointsData). Hunter is the best running back value on the board in dynasty rookie drafts. He's consistently available in the third round of dynasty rookie drafts and will occasionally fall into the fourth round. At the end of the second round, I'm looking at the board and figuring out where which pick I need to acquire to secure his services safely."
25,Cam Skattebo,RB9,23,15,23,19,2.3,-6,Tier 4,"The bulldozing behemoth back from Arizona State is headed to the Big Apple after the Giants picked him in round four of the NFL Draft. Skattebo will immediately compete with Tyrone Tracy for volume in the New York backfield. Skattebo's strengths and weaknesses are well known. He can handle heavy usage, break tackles (21st in yards after contact per attempt last year), and is an underrated receiving option (2024: tenth in yards per route run among running backs, per PFF), but he's not a home run threat. Skattebo has never ranked higher than 91st in breakaway percentage over the last three seasons (per PFF). Skattebo could become New York's volume back in 2025, or he could get stuck in a frustrating committee with Tyrone Tracy. Skattebo is a second-round rookie pick who could go anywhere from the early portion of the round or the tail end, depending on the league and its scoring settings."
26,Mason Taylor,TE6,21,19,35,25.4,5,-1,Tier 4,"Taylor is headed to the Jets after they selected him in the second round of the NFL Draft. Taylor could become the number two target in the passing attack quickly, with only Josh Reynolds and Allen Lazard as his closest competition for targets. I wasn't nearly as enamored as many with Taylor as a prospect. His athleticism was solid, with a 4.68 40-yard dash and an 83rd percentile 3-cone. Taylor should develop into a solid starting NFL tight end, but I have a hard time seeing a pathway to elite status for Taylor. Across his three seasons at LSU, he never ranked higher than 63rd in yards per route run (per PFF). Taylor finished his collegiate career with only 5.4 yards after the catch per reception and 14 missed tackles forced (129 receptions). Taylor is a late second/early third-round dynasty rookie pick that could soak up a ton of volume in year one."
27,Tyler Shough,QB3,25,23,45,33.3,7.8,-7,Tier 4,"With Derek Carr retiring, the pick of Tyler Shough inside the top 50 in the NFL Draft makes more sense. He will compete in camp to be the Saints' Week 1 starter, and I'd even call him the favorite to land the job, considering what we have seen (or have not seen) from the other players in that room. If we assume that he's the Saints' starter for 2025, he has immediate QB2 appeal for Superflex squads. If Shough can play well enough this upcoming season, it's not insane to think that he could be the team's long-term starter, although I'm highly skeptical, and I think it's best to view his starting window as maybe only one year. Last year, he was sixth in passing grade, but he ranked outside the top 20 quarterbacks in adjusted completion rate (30th), yards per attempt (24th), big-time throw rate (35th), and deep ball adjusted completion rate (72nd, per PFF). Shough is in play in the second round/early-third round of dynasty rookie drafts."
28,Jalen Royals,WR10,22,23,38,29.4,5,3,Tier 4,"Royals' draft capital outlook was unclear entering the NFL Draft. Coming from the small school of Utah State, having injuries impact his final season and his predraft process, and the common theme of people discussing this as a ""down"" wide receiver class were all factors that could push him down the board. I was hoping a team would fall in love with him and select him somewhere on Day 2, but it didn't happen. Royals did hear his name called in the fourth round of the draft by the Kansas City Chiefs. Royals will now have to sift through the muddled mess that is the Chiefs' wide receiver room. He's likely (at best) the team's WR4 this season if Xavier Worthy, Rashee Rice, and Hollywood Brown all stay healthy. He could easily find his way into the starting lineup if he can hop Juju Smith-Schuster on the depth chart and Rice misses any time recovering from injury (or suspension), or Brown is unable to stay healthy. Last year, Royals ranked 30th in yards per route run, and he averaged 166.5 receiving yards across his final four collegiate games (per PFF). He's a wonderful dart throw in dynasty rookie drafts in the third round."
29,Kyle Williams,WR11,22,15,28,20.6,3.9,-1,Tier 4,"Williams hive stand up! Williams gained a lot of traction in the fantasy community in the predraft process, with plenty of people hyping up the former Washington State late breakout. I remain a tad below consensus on Williams, but I agree that he is a viable third-round dart throw in dynasty rookie drafts. Williams didn't surpass 900 receiving yards or 2.25 yards per route run in any collegiate season until 2024 (per PFF). The hope for the Patriots' third-round draft pick is that he can avoid faceplanting like Ja'Lynn Polk and Javon Baker did last year. He'll need to hop Mack Hollins, DeMario Douglas, Kayshon Boutte, and Kendrick Bourne to see the field in 2025 as a full-time starter. We'll see if he can accomplish that task. If not, he could disappear into the ether in 2026 like New England's receiver draft picks from the last process are seemingly doing this year. With Williams concerning analytical profile, I don't think the ceiling is extremely high in fantasy, but he's worth selecting in the third round of dynasty rookie drafts if you need wide receiver depth and a flier for your squad."
30,Elic Ayomanor,WR12,22,23,37,28.6,4.5,10,Tier 4,"Ayomanor got a lot of positive buzz during the NFL Draft process, only to slip to the fourth round of the NFL Draft. The fall was possibly due to some medical concerns, but I can't fully confirm that. Ayomanor is a detailed route runner who can stretch the field (top-60 in aDOT across his final two seasons). He lands in a wide-open receiver room behind Calvin Ridley and Tyler Lockett. I wouldn't be surprised to see Ayomanor cracking the starting lineup quickly over Van Jefferson. If he hits, he'll be an outlier, but there's a path for his talent to find a way to targets in Tennessee. Ayomanor is another strong dart to toss in the third round of dynasty rookie drafts."
31,Jaydon Blue,RB10,21,21,32,26.8,4.2,-4,Tier 4,"Blue fell to the fifth round of the NFL Draft as he was swimming in a ridiculously deep running back draft class. The former Longhorn displayed some three-down big play ability in his final collegiate season. He ranked 26th in elusive rating, 35th in yards after contact per attempt, and 25th in yards per route run (per PFF). It's not hard to envision Blue having a role in the backfield immediately in Week 1, considering the lackluster players surrounding him on the Dallas Cowboys' depth chart. Javonte Williams and Miles Sanders' best football looks to be behind them. Blue could be the passing down back from Day 1 with an avenue to become the team's lead back quickly. Blue's a great depth add and dart throw in the third round of any dynasty rookie draft."
32,Pat Bryant,WR13,22,27,53,36.5,7.4,-8,Tier 4,"The Denver Broncos surprised everyone by selecting Pat Bryant in the third round of the NFL Draft. In the post-draft presser, Sean Payton compared Bryant's game loosely to his former standout receiver, Michael Thomas. While I wasn't head over heels in love with Bryant during the pre-draft process, this comparison and his surprising draft capital do raise the antenna. Bryant quietly checks the analytical boxes that we look for, ranking 18th in yards per route run and seventh in receiving grade in his final collegiate season (per PFF). He's worth tossing a dart at beginning somewhere in the third round of rookie drafts."
33,Dylan Sampson,RB11,20,22,39,28.1,4.6,1,Tier 4,"Sampson joins the Cleveland Browns after being selected in the fourth round of the NFL Draft. He'll pair with Quinshon Judkins, forming the new-look duo for the Browns' rushing attack. Yes, Jerome Ford remains on the roster, and Sampson has to outplay him to earn the RB2 job in 2025 officially, but I think that will happen because Cleveland's selection of two backs inside the top four rounds of the NFL Draft speaks volumes about their lack of faith in Ford. This easily could be Cleveland getting an updated version of Nick Chubb and Kareem Hunt for their offense. No, I'm not saying there's a direct comparison with talent, but the usage could be similar. In 2023, Sampson ranked sixth in receiving grade and 14th in yards per route run (per PFF), so there are some reasons to be encouraged with his profile if he does take over the passing down duties for the Browns. Sampson is a late third-round rookie draft pick."
34,Tai Felton,WR14,22,38,56,45.4,6.6,8,Tier 4,"The Vikings called Felton's name in the third round of the NFL Draft. Once he's up to speed, he should push Jalen Nailor for the team's starting slot receiver role. Felton was an outside receiver in college, but he'll need to move inside if he wants a shot at starting. There's no dispute that Justin Jefferson, Jordan Addison, T.J. Hockenson, and the backfield will all be above him in the target pecking order if he does earn the starting job, so there's a limited ceiling here. Felton's analytical profile is worrisome as he didn't surpass 800 receiving yards or 1.90 yards per route run until his fourth and final season at Maryland (per PFF). That isn't the look of a typical profile that screams high upside receiver for fantasy football. Felton is a decent dart throw in the late third round or fourth round of rookie drafts. Just temper your expectations for him."
35,Isaac TeSlaa,WR15,23,31,72,46.9,13.8,-8,Tier 4,"TeSlaa was one of the most surprising picks of the entire NFL Draft, both in relation to his draft capital (round three) and the amount Detroit gave up to trade up for him (three third-round picks). The Lions needed to upgrade their WR3 spot and give them some insurance for Jameson Williams, who could walk after the 2025 season. I just don't know if the highly athletic big slot (68.3% slot in college) in TeSlaa was the right answer. In his two seasons at Arkansas, he never had more than 532 receiving yards. He finished with a disappointing 5.0 yards after the catch per reception, 16.4% target per route run rate, and 1.45 yards per route run. I won't be chasing the overwhelming draft capital with TeSlaa when everything else regarding his film and analytical profile screams to stay away. TeSlaa is just another fourth-round rookie pick that will be added to a multitude of taxi squads."
36,Savion Williams,WR16,23,36,70,45.6,9.1,4,Tier 4,"The Packers added another piece to their already complicated wide receiver room with the selection of Savion Williams in the third round of the NFL Draft. Green Bay looks to continue their wide receiver by committee by approach. Williams is a jack of all trades and master of none, and Matt LaFleur will have fun deploying while fantasy gamers will want to pull their hair out. Williams looks like the WR4 (at best) on the Packers' depth chart, with some duplicity in his possible usage with Jayden Reed. Williams could be LaFleur's version of Deebo Samuel in Green Bay. Last year, he ranked 22nd in missed tackles forced and piled up 322 rushing yards (six rushing scores). Williams is yet another fourth-round/taxi squad addition that could pay off handsomely if everything swings in his direction."
37,Brashard Smith,RB12,22,36,51,44.2,4.5,-9,Tier 4,"Smith was another talented victim of this deep running back class. He dropped all the way to the seventh round of the NFL Draft, which was surprising. The Chiefs added him to their already overstocked backfield. The Chiefs are no strangers to allowing a seventh-round running back a legit shot at starting (hi, Isiah Pacheco), so we can't say that Smith has zero shot. I was enamored with Smith's receiving ability as a converted wide receiver, his lightning quickness, and his possible upside as a rusher for a player who is still getting acclimated to the position. Last year, Smith ranked 34th in breakaway percentage, second in receiving grade, and 22nd in yards per route run (per PFF). Smith is a player that I will prioritize at the top of the fourth round in rookie drafts. He could climb this depth chart quickly. After 2025, Smith and Carson Steele are the only running backs that will be under contract as Isiah Pacheco, Kareem Hunt, Elijah Mitchell, and Keaontay Ingram are all unrestricted free agents."
38,DJ Giddens,RB13,21,28,48,37.2,5.7,-7,Tier 4,"My predraft man crush for Giddens was real. He was my predraft RB6, but his fall to the fifth round of the NFL Draft has cooled my hope and outlook for his NFL future. Giddens was the 15th running back selected in the draft as he landed with the Colts. He'll compete with Khalil Herbert to earn backup duties behind the Colts' incumbent starter, Jonathan Taylor. Giddens' talent is very real after he ranked 16th in yards after contact per attempt, sixth in breakaway percentage, and 22nd in elusive rating last year (per PFF). Taylor has two years left on his current contract, but the Colts can get out of his deal after 2025 with only a 2.5 million dollar cap hit. With the uninspiring draft capital and landing spot, Giddens is just another third-round rookie draft dart throw at this point."
39,Shedeur Sanders,QB4,23,25,59,41.5,9.9,-7,Tier 4,"I'm not going to discuss Sanders' fall in the NFL Draft, but it happened, and now the big question is, ""How do we react in Dynasty rookie drafts?"" Sanders is now a lottery ticket late second-round/early third-round rookie draft pick. He could shine in camp and the preseason and run away with the Browns' starting job or, at the very least, push Joe Flacco and ascend to the QB2 spot. He could be starting at some point this season in Cleveland, or he could sit all year as a backup, who is buried on the depth chart as the team's QB3. There's a wide range of outcomes here, and it depends on how he performs, how others perform around him, and if the Browns make this ""truly"" an open competition for the starting throne. Sanders has the talent to make some noise on the football field in Cleveland. Last year, he ranked third in passing grade, fourth in adjusted completion rate, 12th in yards per attempt, and 18th in deep ball adjusted completion rate (per PFF)."
40,Jalen Milroe,QB5,22,22,42,28.8,5.7,9,Tier 4,"The former Crimson Tide dual-threat signal caller fell to the third round of the NFL Draft despite drawing some late first-round buzz close to the draft. The Seattle Seahawks stopped his tumble by punching his card with the 28th pick of round three. Milroe slots in as Seattle's backup quarterback right now behind Sam Darnold, who has two years of strong money in his newly minted contract. Darnold will need to falter for Milroe to get on the field in the next two years as the team's starter. His draft capital automatically makes him an outlier if he becomes a multi-year starter for Seattle. The rushing upside of Milroe, if he gets the starting opportunity, is enticing, but his skills as a passer are frightening. In his final collegiate season at Alabama, Milroe ranked 60th in adjusted completion rate, 36th in big-time throw rate, and 66th in adjusted completion rate from a clean pocket (per PFF). Milroe will go before I'm willing to take him in most Superflex rookie drafts. It feels more like burning a rookie draft pick than a well-composed dart throw. He's a viable late second-round draft pick if you want to take the plunge, but I'm not drafting him until the late third round."
41,Tahj Brooks,RB14,23,33,58,43.8,6.4,-4,Tier 4,"Brooks lands in Cincy via the sixth round of the NFL Draft. With the depth of his running back class, it isn't surprising to see him having slipped that far down the board, but it still sucks. Brooks has the talent that should have justified an earlier pick and would have had he come out last year. Brooks will need to hop Zack Moss (assuming health) and Samaje Perine on the depth chart to even be proclaimed as the direct handcuff to Chase Brown. I think he has the talent to do so, but it remains to be seen if he can achieve it. Texas Tech's run blocking was abysmal last year, and it hurt Brooks' tackle-breaking numbers. In 2023, he ranked 60th in yards after contact per attempt and 37th in elusive rating (per PFF). Brooks is a nice fourth-round pick and taxi squad candidate for dynasty squads."
42,Devin Neal,RB15,21,28,44,34.4,5.2,-3,Tier 4,"The depth of this running back struck another of my predraft love list players as Devin Neal fell to the sixth round of the NFL Draft. The New Orleans Saints stopped his tumble. Neal will compete with the oft-injured Kendre Miller and Clyde Edwards-Helaire for the RB2 job behind Alvin Kamara. Kamara's contract will keep him in the starter's chair in the Big Easy for at least the next two seasons. Miller also isn't an unrestricted free agent until 2027. We'll see if New Orleans moves back to more of a committee approach with the backfield in 2025, but that hasn't been the case in recent seasons, with Kamara soaking up nearly all of the work. This also might not have been the case had Miller stayed healthy for any period, but that's just guessing. I loved Neal predraft as a running back who has displayed the ability to soak up volume, flash a three-down skillset, and rank in the top 20 in breakaway percentage in two of his final three collegiate seasons (per PFF). With the disappointing draft capital and muddied landing spot, Neal is only a fourth-round rookie pick and taxi squad stash."
43,Dillon Gabriel,QB6,,,,,,,Tier 4,"The diminutive former Oregon Duck heads to the Cleveland Browns after being selected in the third round of the NFL Draft. He'll join Shedeur Sanders in the quarterback meetings alongside Joe Flacco and Kenny Pickett. Gabriel was an accurate college quarterback, but the Oregon offensive system did him a lot of favors. Last year, he ranked eighth in passing grade, third in adjusted completion rate, and 14th in yards per attempt, but when we look deeper, the numbers get concerning. He was also 103rd in big-time throw rate and 132nd in deep throw rate. He wasn't asked to do much outside of present catchable targets for his receivers and operate the offense, which he did at a high level. Gabriel is a fourth-round selection in Superflex rookie drafts that I'll likely be avoiding. If he finds multi-year starting status for Cleveland, he'll be an outlier on a number of levels."
44,Trevor Etienne,RB16,20,26,52,41.2,6.9,6,Tier 4,"With all of the needs that the Carolina Panthers have, I didn't see them investing a fourth-round draft pick in a running back. My big takeaway from this selection, with Rico Dowdle and Chuba Hubbard already on the roster, is that we should be very worried about Jonathon Brooks. We probably don't see him play in 2025, so I understand adding depth to the backfield. It doesn't feel like something that was needed particularly for this upcoming season with Dowdle already signed. Etienne is a talented back who has good vision and a well-rounded skill set, even if he doesn't have any superpower traits. In 2023, he ranked 15th in yards after contact per attempt and 21st in elusive rating before his stats dipped in 2024 (per PFF). The draft capital is the most alluring thing about Etienne. He's a player that I will look to add via waivers after rookie drafts where he's available, but I doubt that I'm spending more than a late fourth-round pick on him (if I have it)."
45,Woody Marks,RB17,24,29,50,40.8,5.9,-1,Tier 4,"The Texans added Marks to their backfield in the fourth round of the NFL Draft. he looks like a passing down back upgrade over Dare Ogunbowale, who can also take on some early down work to spell Joe Mixon occasionally. I wasn't high on Marks as a prospect. Since 2021, he never finished higher than 102nd in yards after contact per attempt or elusive rating (per PFF). He could siphon off some targets from Mixon, though. He has ranked 26th or higher in receiving grade in three of the last four seasons. Marks is a taxi squad candidate and a player I'll wait until waivers run post-rookie draft to acquire unless maybe I have a contending roster and Joe Mixon on the team."
46,Jordan Watkins,WR17,,,,,,,Tier 4,"Watkins was a receiving prospect that I got to late in the evaluation process, but I really liked him. In his final collegiate season, he ranked 36th in yards per route run and 41st in yards after the catch per reception (per PFF). He can play from the slot or on the perimeter, and he has an extensive history of both in college. He's a strong route runner with a varied release package. He could be the 2026 replacement for Jauan Jennings, who will be a free agent after this season. He's another late fourth-round pick or priority waiver pickup (taxi squad must)."
47,Jacory Croskey-Merritt,RB18,,,,,,,Tier 4,"Croskey-Merritt was a predraft love lister for me. Sadley, he dropped all the way to the seventh round of the NFL Draft before the Commanders picked up the phone. If Croskey-Merritt hadn't had his 2024 season cut off by an eligibility issue, he would have gone much higher than this. His 2023 season was excellent. He ranked 19th in yards after contact per attempt and 12th in elusive rating (per PFF). He's a no-nonsense runner who makes one cut and gets downhill. He'll have his work cut out for him to climb up a crowded running back depth chart, but he has the talent to do so. Pick him up with your final rookie pick (late fourth round or fifth round) or as a priority waiver/taxi squad add."
48,Oronde Gadsden IIO. Gadsden II,TE7,,,,,,,Tier 4,"Gadsden was one of many ""big slot"" and receiving ability first and foremost tight ends of this draft class. He finds a home with the Bolts after being selected in the fifth round of the draft. He had his 2023 season cut short by a foot injury. Per PFF, in 2022 and 2024, he ranked inside the top 18 in yards per route run (18th, fifth) and receiving grade (10th, seventh). Gadsden could get a redshirt season in 2025 with Will Dissly and Tyler Conklin ahead of him on the depth chart, but it could be wheels up for 2026. Dissly can be cut after 2025 with only a 1.5 million dollar dead cap hit. Conklin is a free agent after this upcoming season. Gadsden is a fine fourth-round rookie pick or waiver pick/taxi squad addition."
49,Kyle Monangai,RB19,23,34,61,47,7.5,-4,Tier 4,"Well, the Bears didn't address running back early in the draft, but they didn't overlook the position. Chicago selected Monangai in the seventh round of the NFL Draft. Monangai is a squatty pinball back that can handle volume and fight for every blade of grass. He isn't an explosive runner, but he can roll up plenty of chunk gains and handle a ton of volume. Last year, he had 25 or more carries in 55% of his games and at least 18 carries in every game. He'll have to beat out Roschon Johnson for RB2 duties behind D'Andre Swift, but that's not impossible. Johnson hasn't exactly set the league on fire so far, and he has had trouble staying on the field (concussions). Monangai is a decent last-round pick/taxi squad candidate."
50,Dont'e Thornton Jr.,WR18,,,,,,,Tier 4,"I love the addition of Thornton to this Raiders' wide receiver room. He fits in nicely with the receivers they already have on the roster as a field-stretching compliment. He should be starting in three wide receiver sets shortly over Tre Tucker. Thornton had only 34 targets last season, but he posted a whopping 3.72 yards per route run (per PFF). With his elite build-up speed, he will take the top off plenty of defenses in his NFL career. I doubt he will become a high-end target share earner, but he'll win people some fantasy weeks in his career. Pick him up with your last pick or off waivers, especially in best ball dynasty leagues."
51,Chimere Dike,WR19,,,,,,,Tier 4,"Before the Titans added Elic Ayomanor in the fourth round of the NFL Draft, they drafted Dike with the first pick of the round. Dike will compete with Van Jefferson and Ayomanor for the WR3 role in this offense in 2025. Dike is a speedy downfield option (13.6 collegiate aDOT) with drop issues (10.9% collegiate drop rate). He could earn the WR3/field stretching role for the team this season, but I have a hard time seeing him ever become a high-volume target. He's taxi squad material."
52,Gunnar Helm,TE8,,,,,,,Tier 4,"Helm concluded his collegiate career with a productive final season at Texas. He ranked 27th in yards per route run, 23rd in receiving grade, third in yards after the catch, and sixth in missed tackles forced. He destroyed his ankle at the NFL combine and continued testing anyway, which led to some horrid numbers. It's safe to say that I don't think Helm is an elite-tier athlete, but we can chuck those numbers in the trash. The Titans added him in the fourth round of the draft as they were shopping in the skill player bargain bin. Helm could be the team's Week 1 starter, as Chig Okonkwo isn't someone to really worry about holding him off. Helm could develop into a solid/top-15 fantasy type of tight end if everything breaks right for him. Add him to your taxi squads, and let's see what happens."
53,Tory Horton,WR20,22,33,47,39.2,5,10,Tier 4,"Seattle called Horton's name in the fifth round of the NFL Draft. The big, galloping physical receiver could push Marquez Valdes-Scantling this season to be the WR3 for the passing attack. Horton has the raw talent to do so after posting 3.45 yards per route run last year (per PFF). He ranked 43rd and 22nd in the same statistical category in the two previous seasons. Horton is a triple-level threat with the play strength to break tackles (2023: 16th in missed tackles forced). Depending on how many rounds your rookie draft is, Horton enters consideration for dynasty squads in the fourth round, but you could also use a final round selection depending on how many rounds your draft covers."
54,Mitchell Evans,TE9,,,,,,,Tier 4,"The Panthers selected the Notre Dame alum in the fifth round of the NFL Draft. He walks into a crowded tight end room with Tommy Tremble and Ja'Tavion Sanders sitting atop the depth chart. Evans is a better all-around option than either of them. Evans recorded solid blocking scores during his time at Notre Dame and excelled as a receiver. Evans wasn't nearly the same in 2024 as he recovered from a torn ACL. When he was operating at the height of his powers in 2022, he ranked sixth in yards per route run and seventh in receiving grade (per PFF). He's not a top-shelf athlete, so the upside is ultimately capped for him in fantasy circles, even if he can secure the full-time role. That doesn't mean that he can't develop in a TE2 with top-15 upside if it all comes together. Pick him up off waivers and stash him."
55,Ollie Gordon IIO. Gordon II,RB20,21,37,48,43.5,3.5,0,Tier 4,"The big, bruising back out of Oklahoma State was selected by the Dolphins in the sixth round of the NFL Draft. He's currently the RB4 on the depth chart behind Jaylen Wright and Alexander Mattison. He could hop both of them by the end of the season if he can regain his 2023 form. Gordon had a disappointing 2024 season, but the year prior, he ranked 39th in yards after contact per attempt and seventh in breakaway percentage (per PFF). I'm not immensely high on Gordon. He's at the bottom of a long tier of taxi squad stash backs. If I can add him to a dynasty roster for cheap, that would be fine, but I'm not bidding aggressively with FAAB to do so."
56,Jordan James,RB21,21,32,47,39.8,4.5,3,Tier 4,"The 49ers selected James in the fifth round of the NFL Draft. He'll likely begin the year as the team's RB3 with the opportunity to push Isaac Guerendo for the backup job behind Christian McCaffrey. Jordan Mason and Guerendo proved last year that being a solid backup for the 49ers can be fruitful if injuries strike, so for this reason, he's worth a stash on taxi squads. I'm not exceptionally high on him as a prospect, though. Last year, James ranked outside the top 65 FBS running backs in yards after contact per attempt (107th), breakaway percentage (151st), and elusive rating (68th, per PFF)."
57,Marcus Yarns,RB22,,,,,,,Tier 4,"Yarns was a predraft love list player for me. Sadly, he didn't get selected in the NFL Draft. He did sign as a UDFA with the New Orleans Saints. The Saints have a stocked running back room, especially after adding Devin Neal in the sixth round to a depth chart that already included Alvin Kamara, Kendre Miller, Clyde Edwards-Helaire, and Jordan Mims. The hope for Yarns is that he can beat out Mims for the RB4 job on this team. Yarns is a pass-game weapon with three-down upside. Last year, he ranked 22nd in yards after contact per attempt and 19th in yards per route run (per PFF). I'll stash him on as many taxi squads as possible and see how things play out."
58,Thomas Fidone IIT. Fidone II,TE10,,,,,,,Tier 4,"Fidone is one of my favorite taxi squad stash candidates. He'll go undrafted in plenty of leagues. His film was quite intriguing, but his counting stats and analytical profile aren't nearly as impressive. If you're taking shots on highly athletic tight ends (as you should be), Fidone should be on your list. He had a 9.49 RAS score while posting 81st percentile or higher marks in the 40-yard dash, vertical jump, broad jump, short shuttle, and 3-cone. The Giants selected him in the seventh round of the NFL Draft. Fidone is currently the TE5 on the depth chart, but don't be surprised if he can work his way into the TE2/3 conversation on the Giants roster by the end of the season. The Giants have taken plenty of stabs at this type of profile over the last few years (Theo Johnson, Daniel Bellinger) without any of them having massive breakouts. Fidone could finally be the hit at the tight-end position that they have been looking for."
59,Elijhah Badger,WR21,,,,,,,Tier 4,"Prior to the NFL Draft, Badger was one of my favorite underrated players. Unfortunately, the NFL didn't share my admiration for his skill set. He wasn't selected in the NFL Draft and subsequently signed a UDFA deal with the Chiefs. Badger has a mountain to climb to find fantasy relevance, but based on talent alone, he's worth adding to your taxi squads if you have the room. Last year, Badger ranked 14th in yards per route run and yards per route run against man coverage (per PFF)."
60,Damien Martinez,RB23,21,31,51,45.5,5.3,8,Tier 4,"The rugged tackle-breaking former Miami Hurricane was selected by the Seattle Seahawks in the seventh round of the NFL Draft. Martinez could easily hop former seventh-round pick Kenny McIntosh for the RB3 job for Seattle by Week 1. Last year, Martinez ranked eighth in yards after contact per attempt and 16th in elusive rating (per PFF). He's another back worth a taxi squad spot after he likely falls to waivers post-rookie draft. If you feel the need or want to make sure that you secure his services, use your final-round pick on Martinez. Kenneth Walker is an unrestricted free agent after this season. Martinez could walk into 2026 as the RB2 on the depth chart behind only Zach Charbonnet."
61,Gavin Bartholomew,TE11,,,,,,,Tier 4,"Bartholomew took my curiosity captive during the NFL Draft process. His film and athleticism didn't make his lackluster analytical profile. He has an 8.8 RAS score, a 4.7 40-yard dash, an 89th percentile 3-cone, and 91st percentile or higher vertical and broad jumps. This type of athletic ability shows up on his film as he has good bend in his routes and displays decent ball tracking in a limited sample. Bartholomew has intriguing movement skills that give hints that another evolution of his game could occur at the next level. The Vikings selected him in the sixth round of the NFL Draft. He's currently the TE3 on the Vikings depth chart, but he could be the backup to T.J. Hockenson next year as Josh Oliver is a free agent after this season. In tight-end premium formats or deep leagues, he's worth a taxi squad spot."
62,Phil Mafah,RB24,,,,,,,Tier 4,"The Cowboys selected Mafah in the seventh round of the NFL Draft. The hulking former Clemson Tiger enters as the RB4 on the roster surrounded by washed-up veterans and Jaydon Blue. It wouldn't shock me if Mafah makes some noise this preseason by bulldozing backups, and he climbs up the depth chart. He finished his collegiate career with 3.47 yards after contact per attempt (per PFF). He's a taxi squad hero, but unless your taxi squad has plenty of room, he could only be a deep league add because of space."
63,Andrew Armstrong,WR22,,,,,,,Tier 4,"The former Arkansas standout signed a UDFA deal with the Dolphins. In his final collegiate season, he ranked 19th in yards per route run and fourth in receiving grade (per PFF). The Dolphins' receiving depth chart is filled with uninspiring names outside of Jaylen Waddle, Tyreek Hill, and possibly Malik Washington, so don't be surprised if Armstrong can ascend to the WR4/5 spot on this depth chart out of camp. If you're wide receiver needy and have the space, hide him on your taxi squad."
64,Will Howard,QB7,23,35,60,48,6.5,8,Tier 4,"The Pittsburgh Steelers selected Howard in the sixth round of the NFL Draft. With that type of draft capital, if he hits as a multi-year starter, he'll be a massive outlier. I don't usually go chasing late-day three picks in the NFL Draft at the quarterback position, especially those of the pocket passing variety. Stash him on your taxi squad in Superflex leagues if you have the space, but he's not a priority add. Last year, Howard ranked ninth in passing grade, seventh in adjusted completion rate, and fourth in yards per attempt (per PFF)."
65,Riley Leonard,QB8,,,,,,,Tier 4,"The Colts selected Leonard in the sixth round of the NFL Draft. Indy at least seems to have a type when it comes to selecting quarterbacks (Hello: Anthony Richardson and Daniel Jones). These days, they seem to covet mobile and inaccurate signal callers. The rushing upside with Leonard is enticing, but the draft capital and accuracy issues are damning. I'll let others waste a roster spot for the 2025 season on Leonard before likely cutting him from their squads after the season. Last year, Leonard ranked outside the top 45 quarterbacks in FBS in passing grade, yards per attempt, and big-time throw rate (per PFF)."
66,Kyle McCord,QB9,,,,,,,Tier 4,"The Eagles selected the heavy-footed pocket passer out of Syracuse in the sixth round of the NFL Draft. McCord will compete with Doran Thompson-Robinson for the QB3 job in camp. Even if he wins that battle, McCord is best left on waiver wires. I'm not investing a dynasty roster spot in a pocket passer who didn't get sizable draft capital or have even a discernable path to a possible starting job in the next two seasons."
67,Kurtis Rourke,QB10,,,,,,,Tier 4,"The 49ers drafted Rourke in the seventh round. I don't have much interest in the pocket passer. His numbers last year were decent, as he ranked fourth in passing grade and seventh in yards per attempt, but his accuracy numbers are lagging in some areas, sitting at 37th in adjusted completion rate and 24th in big-time throw rate (per PFF). If I take a shot at who could win the 49ers' QB3 battle, it'll be Tanner Mordecai."
68,Quinn Ewers,QB11,,26,80,54.1,11.3,,Tier 4,I don't have any interest in rostering Ewers in any dynasty format. He capped a disappointing collegiate career by getting selected in the seventh round of the NFL Draft by the Miami Dolphins. He's currently the QB3 on the roster with limited upside. He's a checkdown-oriented pocket passer.
69,KeAndre Lambert-Smith,WR23,,,,,,,Tier 4,"The former Auburn Tiger was selected in the fifth round of the NFL Draft by the Chargers. He concluded his final collegiate season with strong marks, with 7.4 yards after the catch per reception and 2.70 yards per route run (per PFF). He's currently the WR5 on the depth chart, but don't be shocked if that changes as the season moves along. If the team decides to keep trotting Quentin Johnston out there and Mike Williams breaks camp with the team, he could be stonewalled, but there's a path for him to ascend if he can show out in the preseason. It's worth holding off adding him to taxi squads right now with the idea that he could quickly added if he makes some noise in training camp and the preseason."
70,Raheim Sanders,RB25,,,,,,,Tier 4,"The rocket crashed and burned as he fell out of the NFL Draft. I figured a team would select him in the final rounds, but it didn't happen. He signed a UDFA deal with the Chargers. He'll walk into camp at the bottom of a deep depth chart on a team that just spent a first-round selection on Omarion Hampton. The best-case scenario for Sanders is that he can climb the depth chart during the season, and when Najee Harris departs after this season, he can cement himself as the RB2 for the team behind Hampton. I wasn't high on Sanders as a prospect. He's an add-to taxi squads in deeper dynasty leagues only, especially those that give a fantasy scoring nudge to carries."
71,LeQuint Allen Jr.,RB26,,,,,,,Tier 4,"The former Syracuse standout fell to the seventh round of the NFL Draft. He landed with the Jacksonville Jaguars. He could climb up the depth chart by season's end to the RB4 spot, but I don't see him hopping anyone else to get higher. Travis Etienne is likely gone after this year, which could help Allen's 2026 outlook, but he profiles as a passing down back in the NFL only and not as a true three-down guy or possible workhorse. Over the last two years, Allen hasn't ranked higher than 119th in yards after contact per attempt (per PFF). In 2024, he was fourth and first in the FBS in receiving yards and receptions among running backs. Allen is a low-end taxi squad stash with a bump in full PPR leagues."
72,Jaylin Lane,WR24,,,,,,,Tier 4,"Kliff Kingsbury can't help himself. Lane lands with the Washington Commanders via the fourth round of the NFL Draft. Lane was a speedy manufactured touch machine at Virginia Tech. Sadly, it didn't amount to much efficiency, as he was 152nd or lower in yards per route run over the last two years (per PFF). This isn't an archetype of a player that has consistently found success in the NFL. I don't have much interest in Lane in any dynasty format. Leave him hanging out on waiver wires."
73,Lan Larison,RB27,,,,,,,Tier 4,"The former UC Davis legend landed with the Patriots after signing on as a UDFA. New England is the land of misfit receiving backs. A monument, for Rex Burkhead and Danny Woodhead, resides somewhere in Foxborough. Let's see if Larison can break camp with the team before adding him to taxi squads (outside of deep leagues). If he can make the NFL roster, then I'm all in for him to be added to squads. Last year, Larison ranked third in receiving grade and sixth in yards per route run (per PFF). In 2023, he was 32nd in yards after contact per attempt and 33rd in breakaway percentage."
74,Joshua Simon,TE12,,,,,,,Tier 4,"In deeper, tight-end premium dynasty leagues, Simon is worth a taxi squad spot. He signed a UDFA deal with the Falcons after failing to be selected in the NFL Draft. Last year, he ranked 25th in yards per route run, 22nd in receiving grade, and seventh in YAC per reception (per PFF). He's an easy player to cut from your dynasty team if he fails to climb up the Atlanta depth chart."
75,Jalin Conyers,TE13,,,,,,,Tier 4,"Conyers signed a UDFA deal with the Miami Dolphins, and he slots in as their TE6 on their depth chart. We'll see if he can break camp with the team before adding him to any dynasty teams. Last year, he ranked 39th in yards per route run and 42nd in receiving grade (per PFF)."
76,Ricky White III,WR25,,36,83,51.8,10.2,,Tier 4,"Seattle drafted White in the seventh round of the NFL Draft. The former UNLV Rebel is limited athletically (4.89 RAS), which will cap his NFL ceiling despite his sterling analytical profile. Over the last two years, White has ranked 15th and second in yards per route run and 23rd and fourth in receiving grade (per PFF). Those numbers don't match up with his testing or his film. White is a deep league taxi option only. He could secure a backup role for Seattle, but I doubt he will crack the starting lineup this year unless a myriad of injuries strike the roster."
77,Nick Nash,WR26,,35,82,54.1,10.2,,Tier 4,"Atlanta signed the former power slot San Diego State standout to a UDFA deal. He's buried on the depth chart, but he could stick in a back up role with the only strong slot option above him is Jamal Agnew. He's a deep-league taxi option only. Last year, he ranked 57th in yards per route run and 21st in receiving grade (per PFF)."
78,Kalel Mullings,RB28,,,,,,,Tier 4,The Titans selected Mullings in the sixth round of the NFL Draft. he could win the RB3 job out of camp with only Julius Chestnut to hop on the depth chart. Mullings is a physical downhill thumper who ranked 55th in yards after contact per attempt and 54th in breakaway percentage last year. He's a deep dynasty league taxi squad add only (preferably with bonuses for rushing attempts).
79,Tez Johnson,WR27,,24,67,38,10.1,,Tier 4,"The Tampa Bay Buccaneers are apparently hoarding slot receivers after adding Emeka Egbuka and Tez Johnson to their wide receiver depth chart alongside Chris Godwin, Sterling Shepard, Rakim Jarrett, and Trey Palmer. The Bucs selected Johnson in the seventh round. I'll let others pick up Johnson on waivers. With this size, rough draft capital, and underwhelming athletic testing, Johnson will be the outlier of all outliers if he turns into a consistent fantasy producer. This isn't the type of profile to chase for dynasty fantasy football purposes."
80,Arian Smith,WR28,,,,,,,Tier 4,"The Jets' admiration for Smith was one of the more confusing things of the entire NFL Draft. Smith is a speedy field stretcher with big-time drop issues that ranked 126th in yards per route run and 249th in receiving grade last year (per PFF). None of that sounds like a player that should have been selected in the fourth round of the NFL Draft, but it happened. If you want to stash Smith on your taxi squad, be my guest, but I'll happily leave him on waiver wires."
81,Jamaal Pritchett,WR29,,,,,,,Tier 4,"The former South Alabama slot dynamo signed a UDFA deal with the Jets. Prichett was a manufactured touch machine during his final collegiate season, ranking fourth in yards per route run and sixth in receiving grade (per PFF). The biggest obstacle to Prichett making the team and being a viable taxi squad add is that New York already has plenty of players with this same skillset on the roster with Xavier Gipson and Malachi Corley. Prichett is best left on dynasty waiver wires for now."
82,Luke Lachey,TE14,,,,,,,Tier 4,Lachey entered the NFL via the seventh round of the NFL Draft as the Houston Texans selected him. Lachey is currently the TE4 or TE5 on their depth chart. His 4.85 40-yard dash is an auto-disqualifier for fantasy purposes. I can name the fantasy tight ends over the last 10-15 years that have found even marginal fantasy success with that slow of a 40 time on one hand. I won't be betting on Lachey to reverse this trend.
83,Jimmy Horn Jr.,WR30,,,,,,,Tier 4,"The former Colorado starting slot receiver landed with the Carolina Panthers. They selected him in the sixth round of the NFL Draft. Horn's less-than-inspiring draft capital, his slot-confined skill set, and his collegiate career 1.55 yards per route run leave him as a prospect that I have zero interest in stashing in dynasty."
84,Xavier Restrepo,WR31,,17,71,34.5,11.1,,Tier 4,"Restrepo signed a UDFA deal with the Tennessee Titans to reunite with his college quarterback, Cam Ward. It's a nice story, but I won't be rostering the turtle slow slot receiver in dynasty. A 4.83 40-yard dash will remove any tight end from my fantasy radar, much less a 5'9"" slot receiver."
85,LaJohntay Wester,WR32,,,,,,,Tier 4,"Wester landed with the Baltimore Ravens via the sixth round of the NFL Draft. He could earn the backup slot role if he has a strong camp, but for a team that loves 12 and 21 personnel, that role has a very limited ceiling, as Nelson Agholor and Devin Duvernay before him can attest to. Wester failed to surpass 2.0 yards per route run in four of his five collegiate seasons (per PFF). When you combine the situation, analytical profile, and lack of draft capital, Wester is a player best left on dynasty waiver wires."
86,Beaux Collins,WR33,,,,,,,Tier 4,"The former member of the Fighting Irish isn't someone I'm going to look to roster in dynasty. His analytical profile was tough to get excited about after ranking 219th in yards per route run and 246th in receiving grade last year (per PFF). Now, add in that he was one of six receivers signed to UDFA contracts with the New York Giants, and it's tough to see him breaking camp with the team."
87,Donovan Edwards,RB29,,,,,,,Tier 4,"Donovan Edwards signed a UDFA deal with the New York Jets. I had Edwards buried in my rankings during the entire process. As the current RB6 on the depth chart, I still have no interest in rostering him in dynasty. Even if Breece Hall were traded before Week 1, I don't foresee Edwards cracking the starting lineup even in a change-of-pace role."
88,Kaden Prather,WR34,,,,,,,Tier 4,"The Bills drafted Prather in the seventh round. The Bills' pass-catching committee approach isn't something I want to invest in. It's too tough to determine where the targets are going on a weekly basis in this passing attack. That's even assuming that Prather could crack the team's starting lineup. Last year, Prather ranked 240th in yards per route run and 222nd in receiving grade (per PFF)."
89,Corey Kiner,RB30,,,,,,,Tier 4,"The 49ers had fun adding another short, squatty back in the draft before Kiner (Jordan James). Kiner was signed as a UDFA after his final season at Cincinnati, ranking 17th in yards after contact per attempt, 28th in breakaway percentage, and fourth in elusive rating (per PFF). I'm not investing in Kiner currently, as he is the RB6 on the 49ers' depth chart. He's more likely a cut candidate in camp and snuck onto the practice squad than an active roster member. If he starts making noise in the preseason, I'll reverse course in deeper leagues."
90,Brady Cook,QB12,,,,,,,Tier 4,"Cook's rushing ability will entice some to roster him on a Superflext taxi squad, but I don't have any interest. While Cook can make plays with his legs, he struggles at times to do so with his arm. Last year, he ranked only 42nd in passing grade and 79th in adjusted completion rate (per PFF). As the QB4 on the roster, he's likely a cut candidate and practice squad addition."
91,Da'Quan Felton,WR35,,,,,,,Tier 4,"I have to leave Felton on the waiver wire. Felton is one of six wide receivers signed to UDFA deals for camp with the New York Giants, so there's plenty of competition here. It's also tough for me to get bullish about his prospects of making the final roster after ranking 217th in yards per route run and 255th in receiving grade last year."
92,Jake Briningstool,TE15,,,,,,,Tier 4,"I don't have any interest in rostering Briningstool. He was signed to a UDFA deal by the Chiefs. He's currently the TE5 on the roster behind four veterans who will all likely make the team ahead of him, and they could only keep three tight ends on the active roster. I hope he latches on with another team, but I'm going to just monitor his situation from afar."
93,Roc Taylor,WR36,,,,,,,Tier 4,"Taylor isn't someone I'm looking to roster in dynasty. He signed a UDFA deal with the Steelers, who currently have 11 wide receivers in camp. With nine of those being veterans, I doubt he will make the final active roster. The Steelers just added veteran Robert Woods, who will be guaranteed a spot behind George Pickens and D.K. Metcalf."
94,Konata Mumpfield,WR37,,,,,,,Tier 4,"Despite my success with previous late-round wide receivers with the Rams, I don't have any interest in rostering Mumpfield in dynasty. He finished his collegiate career with only 1.71 yards per route run and 4.4 yards after the catch per reception. His 6.35 RAS score also doesn't help his case any."
95,Moliki Matavao,TE16,,,,,,,Tier 4,Matavao and his 4.81 40-yard dash are above the threshold of fantasy football viability. He's off my taxi squad stash list.
96,CJ Dippre,TE17,,,,,,,Tier 4,"Dippre will be a better real-life NFL player than a fantasy football option. He profiles as an inline TE2 for a roster. While he is athletic (9.1 RAS), he ranked only 62nd in yards per route run and 101st in receiving grade last year (per PFF). Leave him on waiver wires."
97,Jackson Hawes,TE18,,,,,,,Tier 4,"Hawes won't be a viable fantasy option unless you play in a point-per-pancake league. He's a devastating blocker, but he ranked only 97th in yards per route run last year (per PFF). Bills fans will love him more than Fantasy GMs."
98,Montrell Johnson Jr.,RB31,,,,,,,Tier 4,"Johnson Jr. isn't worth rostering at the moment. He signed a UDFA deal with Philly, and currently, he's sitting at RB6/7 on the depth chart. If the Eagles decide to carry four backs on the roster, it's likely Barkley, A.J. Dillon, Will Shipley, and Tyrion Davis-Price. Last year, Johnson Jr. ranked only 94th in yards after contact per attempt and 61st in elusive rating (per PFF)."
